# BanglaSenti Dataset Preparation: Bangla Sentiment Analysis CSV Dataset for NLP & Machine Learning

**BanglaSenti** is a comprehensive, open-source Bangla sentiment analysis dataset in CSV format, designed for natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and deep learning research. This dataset is ideal for training, fine-tuning, and benchmarking models such as Bangla-BERT and other transformer-based architectures. All data processing, cleaning, deduplication, and column trimming have been completed using Google Sheets data format functions and Apps Script, ensuring high quality and usability. Only the essential files for public delivery are included.

## Files Included
- `banglasenti.csv` ‚Äî The final, cleaned, sentiment-labeled dataset (columns: `text`, `label`). Ready for direct use in NLP and machine learning projects.
- `CITATIONS.md` ‚Äî Full dataset source and citation information for proper academic and research attribution.
- `LICENSE` ‚Äî Apache 2.0 license for open/public use, allowing free use in research and commercial projects.
- `README.md` ‚Äî This documentation, optimized for search engines and user clarity.

## Dataset Sources

## Usage & Applications
- Use `banglasenti.csv` directly for training, evaluation, or research in Bangla sentiment analysis, text classification, and NLP tasks.
- The dataset contains three sentiment labels for supervised learning:
  - 0 = Negative
  - 1 = Positive
  - 2 = Neutral
- The dataset has been expanded with more data and now includes neutral samples, making it suitable for multi-class classification.
- Perfect for use with BERT, Bangla-BERT, and other transformer models, as well as traditional machine learning algorithms.
